# Regression Language Model (RLM) by Google AI

## Overview  
The Regression Language Model (RLM) is a novel framework developed by Google AI that leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform regression tasks by reformulating numerical prediction as a text generation problem. Instead of traditional numeric input-output models, system state data—such as configuration settings, logs, workload profiles, and hardware descriptions—are serialized into structured text formats like YAML or JSON and used as input prompts. The model generates numerical targets, such as performance efficiency metrics (e.g., Millions of Instructions Per Second per Google Compute Unit, MIPS per GCU), directly as text.

This repository provides a lightweight PyTorch implementation inspired by Google’s RLM, demonstrating how text-encoded system configurations can be used to predict performance metrics via neural network regression.

## Features  
- Reformulates regression problems as text generation tasks  
- Converts structured system configuration data into neural model inputs  
- Predicts performance metrics from raw textual system descriptions  
- Simple and extensible PyTorch codebase for experimentation and education  

***

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8+  
- PyTorch 1.8+  
- JSON (built-in)  

### Installation  
Clone the repository and install required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-research/Regression-Language-Model.git
cd Regression-Language-Model
pip install torch
```

***

## Usage  
The core script simulates regression from system configurations serialized as JSON text into numeric performance predictions.

Run the demo training and inference script:

```bash
python demo_rlm.py
```

Sample output:

```
Epoch 50 - Loss: 0.0153  
Epoch 100 - Loss: 0.0048  
...  
Config: {"CPU": 24, "RAM": 96, "DISK": 3000} -> Predicted Efficiency: 6.73  
```

## How It Works  
1. **Data Preparation:** System states are converted into structured JSON text.  
2. **Text-to-Numeric Conversion:** JSON configs are converted into numeric tensors representing system features.  
3. **Neural Regression:** A feed-forward neural network learns to predict efficiency metrics from these numeric encodings.  
4. **Inference:** Given new JSON-configured systems, the model predicts their expected performance.
